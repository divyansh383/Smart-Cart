## Smart Cart Project Overview

The Smart Cart project aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by leveraging advanced barcode scanning technology to streamline the entire process. This innovative solution integrates multiple technological components to create a seamless and efficient shopping environment.

### Components and Technologies

1. **Barcode Scanning and Sensing:**
   - **Raspberry Pi**: The core hardware component responsible for sensing and barcode scanning. Equipped with a camera, the Raspberry Pi captures barcodes in real-time as items are added to the cart.

2. **Backend Data Processing:**
   - **Python Django**: The backend of the Smart Cart is powered by a robust Python Django framework. This layer handles all data processing tasks, including retrieving product information and managing the store database.

3. **Mobile Application:**
   - **Kotlin-based Mobile App**: The frontend is a mobile application developed using Kotlin. This app provides users with a digital display of their cart, showing items added, current totals, and other relevant information in real-time.

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Barcode Scanning:**
   - Utilizing the Raspberry Pi camera, the Smart Cart can scan and recognize barcodes as items are placed in the cart, updating the cart's contents instantaneously.

2. **Automatic Billing:**
   - The system automates the billing process by retrieving data from the store database as items are scanned. This ensures accurate pricing and eliminates the need for manual checkout processes.

3. **Digital Cart Display:**
   - Shoppers can view their digital cart on the mobile app, which updates in real-time with each scanned item. This feature allows for easy tracking of purchases and totals throughout the shopping trip.

4. **Seamless Integration:**
   - The project showcases seamless integration between hardware (Raspberry Pi and camera) and software (Django backend and Kotlin app), providing a cohesive user experience from scanning to checkout.

### Conclusion

The Smart Cart project exemplifies a cutting-edge approach to enhancing the retail shopping experience. By integrating real-time barcode scanning with automated billing and a user-friendly mobile interface, it simplifies the shopping process, making it more efficient and enjoyable for customers. This project stands as a testament to the potential of combining hardware and software innovations in retail technology.
